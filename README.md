# Game of Life in JS

Conway's Game of Life is a set of rules governing the destruction, persistence, or propagation of neighboring cells in a grid â€” a pseudo-simulation of life. It was created by John Horton Conway in 1970, in an effort to simplify a concept by the mathematician John von Neumann in the 1940s. The intent and power of the game is not in realistically simulating life, but rather in serving as a simple system that produces complex behavior. In fact, the Game of Life is a universal Turing machine, capable of modeling any algorithmic calculation.
